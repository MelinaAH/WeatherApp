# WeatherApp
A collaborative Java team project
A simple Java weather application that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap service.

My Areas of Responsibility:

Method Implementation:
- fetchData() and getWindDirectionPath() in the WeatherData class
- fetchDailyData() in the WeatherForecast class

Small Additions and Modifications: To the classes HourlyForecast and WeatherForecast to work with DataFetcher, FileManager, HourlyForecast, ProgramStatus, and WeatherApp
